#Spotify notifications on Slack.

#Aim
The aim is to somehow get spotify notifications from the office music laptop to the #General slack channel. 

##Stage 1 - Passive, as they happen. 
##Stage 2 - Use slash command to query. (Going to be far more complicated.)

#Stage 1
Current idea is to knock together a python script that listens for the notifications, and then uses a WebHook to push that info to the channel.
